# Python-Flock-Simluation
Simulation of flocking behaviour in birds, using the realistic-looking Boids model (1986).

<p>
The Boids simulation follows three core rules:

* Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
* Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates 
* Cohesion: steer to move toward the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
